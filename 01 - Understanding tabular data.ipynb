    "# Summary of chapter 1\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tabular data** is data organized in rows and columns, such as data in CSV files or relational database tables.  \n",
    "- **Structured data** is sometimes used as an alternative term for tabular data, but it’s a broader concept that also includes formats like JSON.  \n",
    "- Tabular data makes up a **small portion** of global digital data, yet it has a **huge impact** on daily life and decision-making.  \n",
    "- Compared to other data types (e.g., images, video, text, audio), **most real-world jobs revolve around tabular data** — making machine learning on tabular data a highly practical skill.  \n",
    "- In this book, we refer to **non-neural network approaches** (from linear regression to gradient boosting) as **classical machine learning** to distinguish them from deep learning.  \n",
    "- **Deep learning on tabular data** gets relatively little attention from researchers, largely due to a **lack of good business datasets** in open-source repositories.  \n",
    "- Conventional wisdom favors using **gradient boosting models** (e.g., XGBoost) for tabular data tasks.  \n",
    "- There is an **ongoing debate** about the role of deep learning in solving tabular problems. This book takes **no sides** but aims to objectively present when and how each approach is appropriate.  \n",
    "- Tabular data has **unique characteristics**, such as the **lack of large public datasets** resembling real-world business problems — unlike the situation with image or text datasets.  \n",
    "- **Generative AI and LLMs** are transforming how AI is used, including in tabular data analysis. LLMs can help automate various tasks, especially those involving **textual inputs and outputs** tied to tabular workflows.\n"
